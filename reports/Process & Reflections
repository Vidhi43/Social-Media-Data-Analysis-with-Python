Process & Reflections:

I began this analysis by simulating a dataset of 20 tweets with attributes such as tweet_id, category, likes, retweets, and timestamp. After loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame, I conducted an initial inspection using .head(), .info(), and .describe() to understand its structure.

I performed data cleaning by checking for missing values, dropping duplicates, normalizing categories, and ensuring timestamps were properly formatted. Once the data was clean, I created several visualizations:
- A histogram to observe the distribution of likes.
- A bar plot to compare average likes across categories.
- A boxplot to check for outliers in each category.
- A line plot to analyze trends in engagement over time.

I also calculated correlations between likes and retweets, and ranked categories by average likes. These analyses highlighted that Politics and Tech categories tend to perform better than Sports or Entertainment.

Reflection:  
This project demonstrated the power of exploratory data analysis to uncover engagement trends in social media. Even with a small simulated dataset, I was able to practice essential EDA skills such as data cleaning, visualization, correlation analysis, and drawing insights. If I had access to a larger real-world dataset, I would extend the analysis by exploring sentiment in tweets, identifying seasonal posting trends, and applying hypothesis testing.

What sets my work apart is the structured, end-to-end approach â€” starting from raw data, cleaning, visualization, analysis, and finishing with actionable recommendations. This replicates a real-world workflow that businesses can use to understand social media engagement.
